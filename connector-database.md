# üõ¢Ô∏è Connecting a Database to My Data

## Overview  
This tutorial explains how to connect relational database sources such as **MySQL**, **PostgreSQL**, and **SQLite** to **My Data**. Using database connectors, you can integrate structured data from existing databases, securely access both live and static datasets, and utilize that data for transformation, analysis, and real-time visualization within the platform.
