# ðŸ”‘ Core Concept

## Overview
This platform is designed to help users manage and analyze data efficiently. The system is built on three main concepts:

1. **Connect Data** â€“ Access and integrate data from external or internal sources.   
2. **Process Data** â€“ Use pipelines to clean, transform, and analyze data.  
3. **Output Result** â€“ Generate insights through visualizations, automated agents, machine learning models, or reusable data.  

## Connect Data
Users can access data in two main ways:  
- **Connecting Data** â€“ Users can integrate their external data sources into the system by uploading files in supported data formats.  
- **Using the Data Library** â€“ Users can access pre-existing data stored in the data library.  

This approach provides flexibility, allowing users to choose the data source that best fits their needs.  

## Process Data
Once data is available, users can process it through the [**Pipeline**](/vdata/pipeline) feature. Pipelines provide a visual and customizable workflow for data processing tasks, including:

- Data cleaning and transformation  
- Statistical analysis or machine learning integration  
- Chaining of multiple processing steps  

The pipeline is built to streamline data operations and encourage reuse across teams.

## Output Data or Result
After processing, users can generate outputs in multiple forms:

- **Visualization** â€“ Build dashboards or charts using [**Xplorer**](/vdata/xplorer) to explore and share insights.  
- **Agents** â€“ Automated chat-based assistants that interact with users and respond to data queries in real-time.  
- **Models** â€“ Machine learning models or analytical algorithms generated from processed data, which can be reused or deployed.  
- **Reusable Data** â€“ Processed datasets that can be stored and used again in other pipelines.

This output system supports decision-making, reporting, automation, and continuous data reuse.
